# Sumwords

**"Know the Facts, Do the Math"**

A constraint-based math puzzle game that combines trivia knowledge with equation solving. Answer trivia questions by placing numbers from a limited pool into mathematical equations while satisfying column sum constraints.

## 🎯 How to Play

### Goal

Place numbers from the number pool into the equation blanks to make valid equations. The sum of each column must match the target shown at the bottom.

### Rules

1. **Answer the trivia question** to learn which number is the solution
2. **Place numbers** from the pool into equation blanks by clicking the pool number, then clicking a blank
3. **Select operators** (Medium/Hard) from dropdowns between operands
4. **Satisfy constraints:**
   - Each equation must be mathematically correct
   - Column totals must match the targets at the bottom
5. **Submit** when all blanks are filled to check your solution

### Tips

- Start by placing the answer to the trivia question
- Work backwards from column totals to narrow down number choices
- Use hints strategically if you get stuck
- Each number can only be used once

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **HTML5** - Semantic structure
- **CSS3** - Responsive design with CSS custom properties for theming
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - No frameworks or dependencies
- **localStorage API** - Persistent data storage for game state and preferences

## 🎲 Game Design

### Puzzle Generation

- Questions are randomly selected from the chosen category
- Equations are generated using a "from" approach (targets calculated from equations)
- Number pools include the correct answer plus additional numbers
- Decoy numbers (Medium/Hard) add strategic complexity

### Difficulty Scaling

- **Easy:** 5 equations, 10 numbers, 5×2 grid, addition/subtraction only
- **Medium:** 6 equations, 12 numbers (2 decoys), 6×2 grid (3×4 mobile), hidden operators (+ or −)
- **Hard:** 8 equations, 16 numbers (6 decoys), 8×2 grid (4×4 mobile), all operators (+, −, ×, ÷)

## 📊 Statistics

The game tracks comprehensive statistics including:

- Total puzzles completed
- Total attempts
- Hints used
- Perfect games (no hints)
- Current and best win streaks
- Per-difficulty breakdowns

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome! This is a personal learning project, but feel free to:

- Report bugs via GitHub Issues
- Suggest new features
- Submit pull requests for improvements
- Add new trivia questions

### Adding Trivia Questions

Questions are stored in `game.js` in the `triviaQuestions` object. Each question needs:

- `question`: The trivia question text
- `answer`: Numeric answer (whole number, 0-2000 range works best)
- `category`: One of the 10 existing categories

Example:

```javascript
{
  question: "How many keys are on a standard piano?",
  answer: 88,
  category: "Music & Arts"
}
```
